Face Reader App allows the user to submit a URL to any image publicly visible on the internet and it will detect and mark all faces present in that image and display demographic data about each person detected. The data presented to the user includes assessment of the person's age, gender and race. The user can click on each face in the image to get data about that specific person. This app uses Clarifai API to analyze images and get the relevant data.
